# Intra-Connect Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to Intra-Connect, your comprehensive tool for managing internal tasks and processes. Designed to streamline workflows within your company, Intra-Connect offers a suite of features tailored to enhance productivity and collaboration.

## Ticket System

### Purpose

The main purpose of tickets is to raise issues to concerned people. Using this we can easily track status of tickets and also check history of tickets.

### Creating a Ticket

    1. Navigate to the 'Tickets Pane' in the sidebar.
    2. Click on the 'New Ticket' button on the right side. A modal will pop up.
    3. Enter the ticket title, description, and files (optional, less than 2MB), and select the assignee(s) for the ticket.
    4. Click on 'Raise Ticket'. The ticket will be raised, and an email notification will be sent to all the assignees.

### Accessing the Ticket

    1. Go to the 'Tickets Pane' in the sidebar.
    2. Select the ticket you wish to view. This will open the ticket detail view.
    3. Here, you can view the description, attached files, assignees, and a chat interface for messaging and file sharing related to the ticket.

### Closing the Ticket

Once a ticket is resolved, it's important to close it:

- Simply click on the 'Close Ticket' button (marked with a red-outlined cross) to mark the ticket as resolved.

## Boards

### Purpose

Boards in Intra-Connect are essential for organizing and tracking tasks within a project. They function like a digital bulletin board, enabling the creation of task cards that can be dynamically moved to reflect progress. This visual arrangement provides a clear snapshot of project status, task responsibilities, and progress, facilitating efficient teamwork and project management.

### Creating a Board (Mainly for Project Managers)

    1. Navigate to the 'Boards Pane' in the sidebar.
    2. Click on the 'New Board' button, located on the right side. A modal will appear.
    3. Enter the Board title and select the assignees for the board.
    4. Click on 'Create Board'. The board will then be created, ready for use.

### Usage

- **Accessing Boards**: Click on 'Boards' in the sidebar to view and interact with all available boards.
- **Creating Lists**: Create a list (a group of cards) by clicking on the 'Add Another List' option.
- **Creating Cards**: After creating a list, you can add new cards by clicking on the 'Add a Card' option within a list.
- **Saving Boards**: It is important to save your changes. Once you are done with your adjustments in boards and lists, click on the 'Save Board' option.

## Workflow and Jobs
